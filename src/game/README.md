# Game Logic

This directory contains the core game logic for the Canary server.

## Key Components

- `Game`: The central class managing the game state (singleton).
- `Map`: Handles the game world map, tiles, and pathfinding.
- `Movement`: Manages creature movement and positioning.
- `Scheduling`: Handles game events and timing.
- `Zones`: Manages map zones (PVP, protection, etc.).
